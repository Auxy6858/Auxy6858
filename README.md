# Hi, I'm Cameron.
I'm a hobbyist programmer from the UK. I first began programming during lockdown out of boredom and it quickly became a hobby of mine. I started my career creating discord bots using [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) and after taking up computer science in highschool, learned python. Ever since then I have been constantly expanding my skills with experiences in languages such as; Assembly, C, C++, C#, IL, Java, JavaScript, Go, Ruby, Python, Rust, SQL, Powershell, Bash and many others.
